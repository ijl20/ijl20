I manage the AdaptiveCity research program in the CS Dept, University of Cambridge, studying dense deployment of sensors both
in the [local region](https://github.com/SmartCambridge) and [in-building](https://github.com/AdaptiveCity). In particular, we
emphasize the use of *stream processing* at every level for the *real-time* data coming from the sensors, i.e. recognizing patterns
and events with the minimum latency.
